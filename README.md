*2023's Very First Anonymous **Trading-System Bot***\
`Ditch your Middle Man that Asks for a Percentage(%)!`

## Ask Yourself
1. Do you want to risk getting scammed by buying an 
item directly from the seller?
2. Do you want to pay a such "__trustworthy__" man a
*percentage(%)* of your revenue?
3. Do you want to go on a website, register, and post your
trading-item just so the person you're selling it to 
buys it, and you never see that website again? *all that work...*
\
\
`It all sounds like a hassle and unfairness, right?`\
`Our trades will strictly only be made through Telegram`\
`Only a few steps to follow. For more info, read "Information"`
